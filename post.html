          Today I'll take a look at the three P's of networking: purpose, people, and process. 
          Your primary purpose should be to establish some level of rapport, ideally developing 
          that relationship over time. People tend to do business with – and hire – people they know, 
          like, and trust.
        </p>

        <h2>Section 1.1</h2>
        <p>
          Use LinkedIn’s filters to identify the people to whom you’d like to be introduced. I call it the “bread crumb 
          trail.” Call your first level connection… the one who is also connected to your target person… and ask your 
          first level person to email your target, copying you, as a means of electronic introduction… encouraging your 
          target to give you a few minutes for networking purposes.
        </p>
        <h3>Section 1.1</h3>
        <p>
          networking is to gather information, particularly if you’re considering a change in careers.  You could call this 
          informational interviewing. Actually, networking and informational interviewing go hand in hand, the primary difference being there’s 
          less information required when you’re trying to stay in the same field.  In that case, the information you’d seek would pertain to that 
          person’s employer… its corporate culture, growth plans, etc.
